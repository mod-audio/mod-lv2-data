The DS1 is modeled after the legendary BOSS DS-1(*), a distortion pedal mainly used for guitar.

Simply put, the DS1 distortion pedal is a modern classic. It was first produced in 1978 and is still widely popular. No wonder it was part of pedalboards from great names such as Kurt Cobain, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Josh Klinghoffer.

The DS1 features three knobs which can take the sound in a variety of different directions. By cranking up its tone levels and distortion knobs, you can pull out a range of different tones, from subtle bite to rich crunch to all-out fuzz. The midrange on the DS1 is scooped, giving it a distinct tonal flavor, which many players prefer. Want sonic reference? Give Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" a listen - all that crunch came courtesy of a DS1.
